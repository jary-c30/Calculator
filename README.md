# Calculator
For this project I will be making a simple calculator that does exponents, division, addition and subtraction(order
of operation: 1.exponents(^), 2.divsion(/), 3.multiplication(*), 4.addition/subtraction(+/-)) the way this calculator 
works is it does all calculaions from left to right in respects to order of operations. The expression the user inputs 
must be inputed in one line, the inputed numbers must be postive intergers only(natrual numbers). For example, input:5 + 3 + 2 ^ 2, 
input: 5 / 2 + 4 * 2 and input: 5 / 2 + 3 ^ 2 * 5 - 2. You can have as many white spaces inbetween(example: 5   / 3*4   +2) just make 
sure there is an operator between 2 positive integers. If inputed anything else, but operators and numbers you will be asked to 
input a valid expression.

example inputs for the expression:

    example 1:
    input: "3 ^ 5 ^ 2"
    output: 59'049
    
    The processes for exponents in this calculator is it does 3 ^ 5 which is 243 then it does 243 ^ 2 which is 59049. 
    IT DOES NOT DO 3 TO THE POWER OF 5 TO THE POWER OF 2!!!!!!
    
    example 2:
    input: "5+5/2*4^2-8"
    ans: 37
    
When you finsih putting in your expression just press enter and a statement with the ans will be outputed.
